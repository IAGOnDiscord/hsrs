# HSRS

A horizontally spinning rat TUI program, written in Rust. It can do other ASCII animations too, I guess.

Inspired by [Mcharlsto/rat on Github](https://github.com/Mcharlsto/rat).
The best jokes are the ones that you take way too far.

**Currently a work in progress.** See milestone tracker for more details.
